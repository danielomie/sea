# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

```

Tests in `tests/unit/` follow the pattern `NN_name.sea` + `NN_name.expected`; the runner diffs stdout against the expected file.

## Architecture

### VM Pipeline

Source `.sea` → **Lexer** (`sea_lexer.c`) → **Parser** (`sea_parser.c`, `sea_ast.c`) → **Compiler** (`sea_compiler.c`) → bytecode (`SeaChunk`) → **VM** (`sea_vm.c`)

The VM is a register-based interpreter using GCC computed-goto dispatch (`&&label` / `goto *dispatch_table[op]`). The `DISPATCH()` macro fetches the next instruction, saves `frame->ip`, and jumps — meaning `frame->ip` always points to the *next* instruction, so line-number lookups use `frame->ip - 1`.

### Value Representation

All values are NaN-boxed 64-bit words (`sea_value.h`). The quiet-NaN space encodes: nil, booleans, 48-bit signed integers, and heap object pointers. IEEE 754 doubles occupy the non-NaN space. Integer literals compile to `int` (distinct from `number`/float); `==` still compares them numerically (`1 == 1.0` is true).

### Memory Management

Objects are **reference-counted**, plus a **cycle collector** for reference cycles (`src/sea_gc.c`, no tracing GC); the full model is in `docs/memory.md`. Ownership is decided at compile time, not by the register file:

- **Named locals (and parameters) own their value** (+1). The compiler releases them at every scope exit: end of block, `break`/`continue`, `return`, `?`. Assignment uses `OP_SETLOCAL`, which stores the new value (retaining it if borrowed) and then releases the old one.
- **Temporaries** carry `is_owned` in `SeaRegMeta` when they hold a reference that must be consumed: moved into a local, passed, returned, stored with a `*_MOVE` op, or released (`own_temp` / `drop_temp` in `sea_compiler.c`).
- **Arguments are passed owned**; the callee owns its parameters. **Return values are owned.** The VM releases a native call's args after the call, and releases results nobody takes.
- `is_scalar` facts (numbers, bools, nil, pinned string constants) let the compiler skip RC entirely. They are tracked with the same sound dataflow as `is_int`.
- **Cycles:** a release that leaves a container (array/table/map/struct/closure/upvalue/error) with a non-zero count buffers it as a possible root, in the running goroutine's VM. At safe points (allocations, returns, JIT helpers, goroutine end, `gc.collect()`), the collector frees what only internal references keep alive (Bacon–Rajan trial deletion). It handles only objects that are not shared; `SeaObject.gc` and `gc_idx` hold its flags. Any VM code that frees objects outside a safe point must not hold borrowed pointers across a collection.
- **Storing into a shared container marks the value shared** (`sea_store_barrier`), so "not shared" really means "seen by one goroutine".
- **Small arrays are one allocation:** `sea_array_new` with a capacity up to `SEA_ARRAY_INLINE_MAX` (8) puts the elements right after the header (`SEA_ARRAY_IS_INLINE(a)`); growing moves them to their own buffer. Code that frees or reallocates `a->data` must check it (`sea_array.c`, `gc_free_white`).
- **The cycle collector's root buffer is compacted when full** (freed candidates leave NULL slots): a native looping over `sea_vm_call` (`csv.each`) reaches no safe point, and past 65535 slots (`gc_idx` is 16 bits) dying candidates would linger until the next collection.

**Native C functions** (`sea_obj_val(&x->obj)` makes a `SeaValue` *without* changing RC):
- Arguments are **borrowed**: never release them.
- **Return an owned (+1) value.** A fresh object (RC=1) is returned as is. An argument or a container element must be retained first: `return sea_val_ref(args[0]);`.
- `sea_array_push`, `sea_table_set`/`sea_table_set_str` and `sea_map_set` **retain** what they store, so drop your own reference afterwards.
- `sea_vm_call()` takes borrowed args and returns an owned result: release it if unused.

```c
SeaTable *entry = sea_table_new(TABLE_MAP);
sea_table_set_str(entry, "k", val);
sea_array_push(out, sea_obj_val(&entry->obj));
sea_obj_release(&entry->obj);  /* array retained it; drop our ref */
return sea_obj_val(&out->obj); /* new object: already +1 */
```

### Module / require() System

`require("path")` searches in order:
1. Directory of the requiring source file + path (`.sea` then `.so`)
2. Current working directory + path
3. Bare names: `sea_modules/` (packages from `sea get`) next to the requiring file or above
4. Each directory in `SEA_PATH` (colon-separated env var)
5. Bare names: `<dir of the sea binary>/../lib/sea/` (the libraries `make install` puts
   there: `require("json")` → `lib/sea/json/json.so`); not installed, a `bin/sea` in the source
   tree uses `<repo>/libs/` the same way (`require("http")` → `libs/http/http.sea`).
   tools/lib/check.sea, tools/build.sea and
   tools/lsp.sea repeat this search: keep them in sync with `src/sea_stdlib.c`

Before the search: built-in modules, the embedded `sea/test`/`sea/check`/`sea/stream`/`sea/flags`/`sea/log`/`sea/dotenv`, then (in a
`sea build` executable) the bundled modules.

Native libraries are `.so` files exposing a `sea_open` entry point. `json` and `csv` are also compiled into the binary (`EMBED_LIBS` in the Makefile: `-Dsea_open=sea_open_<name>`, registered by `sea_lib_embedded_register`), so they are globals. The `libs/` directory contains: `console`, `json`, `yaml`, `toml`, `csv`, `compress`, `xml`, `tensor` (native `.so`), `ndarray` (NumPy-like arrays: Sea + native), `http`, `ssl`, `jwt`, `websocket`, `duckdb`, `sqlite`, `embed` (Sea + native; `embed` runs GGUF embedding models with llama.cpp) and `flags`, `test`, `template`, `stream`, `log`, `dotenv`, `image` (PNG, BMP, PNM, JPEG), `truetype`, `pdf`, `cockroach` (PostgreSQL wire protocol), `clickhouse` (HTTP interface), `smtp` (e-mail) (pure Sea; `test`, `stream`, `flags`, `log` and `dotenv` are embedded as `sea/test`, `sea/stream`, `sea/flags`, `sea/log`, `sea/dotenv`) — see `docs/libs.md`.
TCP sockets are the built-in `net` module (`src/sea_lib_net.c`); `libs/ssl` and `libs/http` build on it.
The parser is also exposed to Sea code as the built-in `sea/parser` module (`src/sea_lib_parser.c`:
parse, tokenize, check, walk, format). Changing the AST (`sea_ast.h`) or the parser means updating
its conversion there, then `make test-format` (format every `.sea` file, reparse, compare the
trees, format again).

**Require paths are relative to the requiring file**: a lib's own examples use `"../libname"`; files under `examples/<name>/` reach a library as `"../../libs/json/json"`.

## Portability

Linux only (epoll/eventfd in the netpoller), tested on x86-64 and aarch64.
Keep arch-specific code behind `#if defined(__x86_64__)` / `__aarch64__` with a
plain fallback: the pinned dispatch registers (`SEA_PIN_REG_*` in `sea_vm.c`),
the SIMD map probe (SSE2/AVX2/NEON in `sea_map.c`), the spin-wait hint. `char`
is unsigned on aarch64: never rely on its sign (cast to `unsigned char` or
`int8_t`).

## Adding or Changing an Opcode

`sea_op_reads()` in `src/sea_chunk.c` is the single list of which registers each
opcode reads (derived from its handler in `src/sea_vm.c`). The compiler's dead-write
elimination and the JIT's register promotion both depend on it: a missing read lets
the compiler delete a live write — a silent miscompilation (Bugs 10 and 14 in
`docs/bugs.md`). When adding an opcode or changing what a handler reads, update it,
and if the JIT gets a helper for it, declare what the helper writes in `op_regs()`
(`src/sea_jit.c`). Check with `make test-dwe` (`SEA_DWE_CHECK=1` turns eliminated
writes into a visible poison value; `SEA_NO_DWE=1` disables elimination).

## Natives That Wait (netpoller)

A native that waits on a socket or timer must not block its scheduler thread.
It must go through `src/sea_netpoll.h`: `sea_io_begin` → `sea_io_wait` → return
`SEA_PARK_VAL` on `SEA_IO_PARK` → `sea_io_end` when done. The VM then re-executes
the whole `CALL` when the goroutine wakes, so the native must be **idempotent up
to the wait**: keep partial progress in `vm->io_call` (`progress`, `aux[]`), not
in locals, and allocate nothing before the last possible park. Close sockets with
`sea_netpoll_close(fd)` so parked waiters wake. The usage pattern is in the
header comment, and `src/sea_lib_net.c` and `libs/ssl/ssl_native.c` are worked
examples. Plain blocking calls (file I/O) still hold the thread; `net.connect`
resolves names on a resolver thread pool instead.

## Runtime Errors and Panics

`sea_vm_error_noreturn()` no longer exits: it raises a panic (`sea_vm_raise`)
that `longjmp`s to the innermost VM loop, which unwinds frames running their
defers until a `recover()` (see "Panics" in `docs/architecture.md`). So C code
in the VM that can raise must not hold a lock or own an unreleased resource
at that point. Natives should still report failures as error values.

## Keeping `docs/reference.md` Up-to-date

**Rule:** whenever you change a built-in library (`src/sea_lib_*.c`) or the language syntax (parser/compiler), also update `docs/reference.md` in the same commit/session. This includes:
- Adding or removing registered functions in any `sea_lib_*_register()` call
- Changing function signatures or behaviour
- Adding or removing keywords, operators, or syntax constructs

## Keeping `docs/libs.md` Up-to-date

**Rule:** whenever you change an external library under `libs/` (any `.sea` or `.c` file), also update `docs/libs.md` in the same commit/session. This includes:
- Adding or removing public functions in any `libs/*/` module
- Changing function signatures, option tables, or return shapes
- Adding a new library under `libs/`

## Sea Language — Key Gotchas

`docs/sea-for-ai.md` is the complete guide for writing Sea (rules, syntax, stdlib, translations;
its examples are checked by `tests/unit/132_ai_guide`): keep it in sync when the language changes.

- **Arrays are 0-indexed.** Create them with `[]` or `[a, b, c]` and append with `arr[] = v` (there is no `array()`/`push()`); nested: `[ [1, 2], [3] ]` with a space, since `[[` opens a long string. `{1, 2, 3}` is a positional *table* with keys 0, 1, 2, not an array. Use `len()`, not `#`. (`[n]` is a one-element array; the old capacity form is gone.)
- **`for-in`** works on arrays (`for i, v in arr do` → 0-based index, value), maps/tables/structs (key, value) and channels (value until closed).
- **Numeric for is inclusive on both ends:** `for i = 0, n-1 do` iterates n times. When n=0 this becomes `for i = 0, -1 do` — correctly executes zero iterations (fixed 2026-05; no guard needed).
- **Loop variables are fresh per iteration** (numeric `for` and `for-in`, as in Lua 5.4 / Go 1.22): closures and goroutines created in a loop body capture that iteration's value — no `local j = i` copy needed (changed 2026-10).
- **String indexing is 1-based** in `string.sub`, `string.find`, `string.byte` (matching Lua convention), but array/table indexing is 0-based.
- **Strings are bytes; source is UTF-8.** `len` and `string.*` count bytes (`len("é")` is 2); the built-in `utf8` module counts characters (`utf8.len`, `utf8.sub`, `utf8.upper`, ...). A `.sea` file with invalid UTF-8 is a compile error; `"\u{E9}"` writes a code point. Native code uses `src/sea_utf8.h`.
- **Cycles** are freed by the cycle collector (automatically, or `gc.collect()`), except cycles of objects shared between goroutines, which still leak; break those by setting a field to nil (see `docs/memory.md`).
- **`int` is 48-bit** (±140 737 488 355 327). Wider integers are `bigint`s, an explicit type: `bigint.new("…")` and `bigint.add/sub/mul/div/mod/pow` (the operators `+ - *` do not take bigints; comparisons, `==`, `tostring`, `..` and `sort` do).
- **`//` and `%` floor** (toward minus infinity) for ints and floats: `-7 // 2` is `-4`, `-7 % 2` is `1`.
- **Compound assignment** `+= -= *= /= //= %= ^= ..=`: for a simple target the parser builds `a = a op b` (assign.op_wrapped), so every analysis sees the real value; `t[f()] += 1` goes through compile_compound_assign (hidden locals `(o)`, `(k)`).
- **Template strings** use backquotes: `` `total: ${n}` `` (NODE_TEMPLATE, compiled to one OP_CONCAT). `"${x}"` is plain text (re.gsub uses `${name}` in replacements) and `f"x"` is a call.
- **`string.find` is plain text**; regular expressions are the built-in `re` module (RE2 syntax, linear time, no backreferences or lookaround).
- **`isnan` / `isinf`** are registered as bare globals (in addition to `math.isnan` / `math.isinf`).
- **Runtime errors are panics**: `recover()` in a deferred call catches them (Go semantics: the recovering function returns nil). The message starts with `file:line:`. Unrecovered, they print a traceback of `file:line: in main chunk` / `file:line: in function 'name'` lines (each function knows its source file: `SeaChunk.source`).
